Central claim unit: a5
Original order:
e1 opp The idea of the bachelor degree is to put together a cumulative grade from various individual assignments in order to generate a final grade.
e2 opp This is also more akin to the real working world later, where performance isn't singular, but constant and has to be delivered over longer periods.
e3 opp That's why it makes sense that the bachelor thesis only makes up a relatively small portion of the final grade (15 out of 120 credits).
e4 pro However, the effort required for the individual equally weighted modules differs strongly.
e5 pro It would therefore be wise to adjust the required effort for final theses accordingly.
