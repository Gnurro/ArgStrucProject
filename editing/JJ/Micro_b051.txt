Central claim unit: a6
Original order:
[e1] [opp] Due to the increase in opening hours on Sundays and holidays there is a rise in employment.
[e2] [pro] However it's mainly temps (that is, students, pupils etc.) who are employed,
[e3] [pro] so this has hardly any effect on the level of full-time employment and the number of unemployed.
[e4] [pro] On top of that, private and family life suffers massively because of this reduction and shifting in designated off-times.
[e5] [pro] And it’s only the large companies that can afford the additional personnel expenditure.
[e6] [pro] For these reasons supermarkets and shopping centres should not be allowed to be open for business on arbitrary Sundays and holidays.
