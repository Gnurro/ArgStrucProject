Central claim unit: a6
Original order:
e1 pro I think Berlin with its two inner-city airports was lucky not having to experience an airplane catastrophe for decades.
e2 pro For safety reasons alone I find continued operation wrong.
e3 pro Also, Berlin urgently needs inner-city areas for business and industry, and for housing.
e4 pro Closing down Tegel will have health benefits for hundreds of thousands in the approach path.
e5 pro These areas will be upgraded economically due to these factors (housing health and employment).
e6 pro After the new BER Airport has been commissioned, Tegel should definitely be closed.
