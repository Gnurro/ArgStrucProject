Central claim unit: a1
Original order:
e1 pro I am not of the opinion that the retirement age should be set at 63 years.
e2 pro This would mean that organizations would be lacking a great deal of manpower in the future.
e3 pro The introductory phase of retirement at 63 would also be a particular challenge
e4 pro as upon introduction many current employees of advanced age would immediately be eligible to retire.
e5 pro This is detrimental for Germany as a business location and leaves employers without a transition period.
e6 pro The danger here is that experienced junior staff is not available in sufficient numbers.
