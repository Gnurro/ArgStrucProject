Central claim unit: a5
Original order:
e1 pro Rent prices are already regulated in favour of tenants due to existing laws and the rent index.
e2 pro In view of the high prices for buying flats with existing rent contracts, these are an unattractive investment.
e3 opp Even if one might think that additional rent control is needed besides the current tenant protection,
e4 pro one should not deny longstanding owners the opportunity to adjust their returns to market level.
e5 pro A cap on rent increases upon tenant change is therefore not to be supported.
