Central claim unit: a1
Original order:
e1 pro Alternative treatments should be subsidized in the same way as conventional treatments,
e2 pro since both methods can lead to the prevention, mitigation or cure of an illness.
e3 pro Besides it should be in the interest of the health insurers to recognize alternative medicine as treatment,
e4 pro since there is a chance of recovery.
e5 pro It doesn't matter after all that those who administer the treatment don't have 'doctor status'.

COMMENT: e3 could now be perceived as central claim unit, as it is very similar and communicates the same overall stance; switching order of e1,e2 does not lead to open reference as "both methods" is inferable; edits preserve surface structure well; usable for survey
