Central claim unit: a1
Original order:
e1 pro Well, I as an employee find it very practical to be able to shop at least on weekends.
e2 opp Sure, other people have to work in the shops on the weekend,
e3 pro but they can have days off during the week and run errands at their leisure while I'm stuck in the office.
e4 pro Plus, the state wants me to spend my money,
e5 pro and how am I supposed to do that when the shops aren't open when I'm off work?
