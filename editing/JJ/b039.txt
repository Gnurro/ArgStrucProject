Original order:
e1 pro The EU should exert influence on the political events in Ukraine.
e2 pro The developments in that conflict should not be left to former Cold War opponents alone,
e3 pro for that course can only lead to escalation in some form.
e4 pro Furthermore, Ukraine is culturally and geographically much closer than other countries that the EU (used to) get involved with.
e5 opp Indeed one could argue that a country has to deal with internal political changes itself,
e6 pro but political power also brings about political responsibility, in this case the responsibility to protect the Ukrainian people from the rather strong interests of the two Great Powers.
