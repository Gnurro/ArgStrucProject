Central claim unit: a6
Original order:
e1 opp Due to the increase in opening hours on Sundays and holidays there is a rise in employment.
e2 pro However it's mainly temps (that is, students, pupils etc.) who are employed,
e3 pro so this has hardly any effect on the level of full-time employment and the number of unemployed.
e4 pro On top of that, private and family life suffers massively because of this reduction and shifting in designated off-times.
e5 pro And itâ€™s only the large companies that can afford the additional personnel expenditure.
e6 pro For these reasons supermarkets and shopping centres should not be allowed to be open for business on arbitrary Sundays and holidays.
