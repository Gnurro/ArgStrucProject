Central claim unit: a1
Original order:
e1 pro Health insurance companies should not cover treatment in complementary medicine
e2 opp unless the promised effect and its medical benefit have been concretely proven.
e3 pro Yet this very proof is lacking in most cases.
e4 opp Patients do often report relief of their complaints after such treatments.
e5 pro But as long as it is unclear as to how this works, the funds should rather be spent on therapies where one knows with certainty.
1. Inspection:
1.1
Inseparable bigrams: [(e1,e2),(e2,e3)]; COMMENT: this is more about e1-e3 strongly referring to each other. rearrangement might still be possible, refer to phase 2.
No bigram/unit move no-gos, aside from bigram chain
No clear unit/position no-gos
1.2
e3: 'this very proof' -> e2 'promised effect and its medical benefit have been concretely proven'; no simple NP available
e4: 'such treatments' -> e1 'treatment in complementary medicine'; NP: 'treatment in complementary medicine'; COMMENT: awkward, but maximally preserving
e5: 'this' [39:43] -> e1 'complementary medicine'; NP: 'complementary medicine'; COMMENT: might also refer to all of e4, which is far more complex than a simple NP. replacement with topic NP seems viable.

COMMENT: simple move breaks sentence and reference; e3 reference of e2 broken; e1 last breaks structure on too many levels -> moving on to next text for survey prep
