COMMENT: there is ambiguous reference in the original text, as e4 "such measures" might refer to "the morning-after pill", while the plural suggests a reference to "state-of-the-art contraceptives". as the latter seems the more natural reference in the first place, not preserving the ambiguity is viable; usable for survey
