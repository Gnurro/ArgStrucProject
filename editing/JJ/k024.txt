Central claim unit: a1
Original order:
e1 pro Dog owners should pay higher fines for dog dirt left on pavements,
e2 opp although there aren't enough bins and bag-dispensers for dog dirt.
e3 pro One reason for this is that they have thus far hardly had to fear the consequences despite the obligation to clean up.
e4 pro A higher fine, so dog owners would have to dig deeper into their pockets, is supposed to be a deterrent after all.
e5 pro The city, especially the green spaces, should be kept tidy after all,
e6 pro for they are there for our recreation.
e7 pro Besides you're not allowed to leave other rubbish without punishment.
1. Inspection:
1.1
Inseparable bigrams: [(e1,e2),(e5,e6)]; (e1,e2) need to retain rebuttal relation; (e5,e6) direct support chain needs to be preserved, and e6 referring to embedded clause makes preserving order necessary
e3 must follow e1, to preserve full proposition reference;
e4 must follow e1, so the misdemeanor to be fined is established (no one should be fined for just having a dog);
e6 must directly follow e5, due to reference to embedded clause 'especially green spaces';
e7 must follow e1, to license 'other rubbish'
1.2
e3 'this' [18:22] -> entire e1, or "higher fines"/"higher fines for dog dirt"; COMMENT: Awkward reference, could be construed to refer to e2.
e3 'they' [28:32] -> e1 'Dog owners'
e6 'they' [4:8] -> e5 'green spaces'
