Central claim unit: a1
Original order:
e1 pro Intelligence services should be more closely regulated by parliament,
e2 pro for, as the most recent NSA wiretapping scandal has shown, the federal state government is allegedly not always familiar with the scope of operations of its intelligence services.
e3 pro Checks could contribute to restricting the so far rather opaque scope of action of individual services.
e4 opp Yet it remains questionable whether the actual implementation of such supervision would at the same time lead to a stronger observance of laws,
e5 opp as ultimately this decision is in the hands of the respective government leaders.
