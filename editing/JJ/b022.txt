e2 opp People are getting older on average,
e3 pro but they are not sicker and not duller because of it.
e4 pro Without them we'd forgo a great deal of collected experience.
e5 pro And we'd have to offer more leisure activities for seniors.

e3: "they" [8:12] -> e2 "People"; NP: "People"; COMMENT: might not be a viable replacement NP, proper reference is probably "people who are getting older (which applies to the average person)"
e3: "it" [52:54] -> e2 "getting older on average"; no simple NP available

(trying to move central for survey)
Move: [1,2,3,4,5]->[2,3,4,5,1]
e2 opp People are getting older on average,
e3 pro but they are not sicker and not duller because of it.
e4 pro Without them we'd forgo a great deal of collected experience.
e5 pro And we'd have to offer more leisure activities for seniors.
e1 pro No, the retirement age should be raised to 65 again.
COMMENT: e1 "No" works as emphatic rethoric element here, whereas the original is (wrongly) replying to the writing prompt, so this seems less awkward; usable for survey
