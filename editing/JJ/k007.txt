Central claim unit: a1
Original order:
e1 pro Supermarkets and shopping centres should be allowed to open any Sundays and holidays at their discretion.
e2 pro For in this way, Sunday shopping days would be better spread out through the year.
e3 pro Also streets and shops would presumably be emptier
e4 pro as not everyone would be open on the same day.
e5 opp However then you'd have a worse overview of which shop is open on a given day.
