Central claim unit: a6
Original order:
[e1] [pro] For years there has been a housing shortage in Berlin,
[e2] [pro] so that using Tempelhofer Feld, which offers a lot of open space and is currently hardly developed, as living space is a sensible idea.
[e3] [pro] Since the area belongs to the federal state, or the federation,
[e4] [pro] it could even be used for social housing with affordable rents.
[e5] [opp] Admittedly the fields have currently become an attractive leisure park with sporting areas for many visitors and Berliners, especially in spring and summer.
[e6] [pro] If however one could find a compromise between green space and housing, then Tempelhofer Feld should definitely be made available for residential construction.
