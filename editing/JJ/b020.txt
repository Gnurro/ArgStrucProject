-> Computer games should not be recognized as Olympic events,
e5 pro Since however skat, chess etc. are not accepted as Olympic events,
["Since"->"since"]
[-"however"] COMMENT: marker for rebuttal, but this unit plainly supports central claim, as already annotated in arggraph; seems rather confusing/redundant in original text already
[+"also"] COMMENT: used in first part of compound sentence to indicate same category assignments, thus inserting here instead to preserve original semantics as much as possible
[","->"."]
