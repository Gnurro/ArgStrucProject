Central claim unit: a1
Original order:
e1 pro Considering what's on television these days, it would be appropriate to only have those people pay who actually (want to) follow the programming.
e2 pro In some cases there are only shows for older generations on at prime times, so why then should everyone pay for this?
e3 pro By now you have advertising on all channels,
e4 pro so there's no advantage for the current paying viewers of the public broadcasters.
e5 opp Nevertheless one has to point out that there'd probably be way fewer stations if it weren’t the whole of Germany that’s obliged to pay.
e6 pro That shouldn't be an issue though, given the sheer number of programmes and stations that essentially show the same things anyway.
