Central claim unit: a5
Original order:
e1 opp Owner-run shops may potentially be overwhelmed by additional work times on Sundays and holidays,
e2 pro then again supermarkets and large shopping centres dominate the market today already.
e3 pro Thus smaller shops could benefit from the additional freedom,
e4 pro as customers are on average more laid-back on Sunday.
e5 pro Opening on Sundays and holidays would therefore help both customers and shops.
