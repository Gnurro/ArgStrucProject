Central claim unit: a6
Original order:
e1 pro For years there has been a housing shortage in Berlin,
e2 pro so that using Tempelhofer Feld, which offers a lot of open space and is currently hardly developed, as living space is a sensible idea.
e3 pro Since the area belongs to the federal state, or the federation,
e4 pro it could even be used for social housing with affordable rents.
e5 opp Admittedly the fields have currently become an attractive leisure park with sporting areas for many visitors and Berliners, especially in spring and summer.
e6 pro If however one could find a compromise between green space and housing, then Tempelhofer Feld should definitely be made available for residential construction.
