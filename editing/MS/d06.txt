Central claim unit: a1

Original order:
[e1] [pro] Peter should close his snack bar as soon as possible.
[e2] [pro] Pricing pressures are just too high,
[e3] [pro] and his pool of customers is shrinking constantly.
[e4] [opp] Of course he could do another big ad campaign,
[e5] [pro] but that won't do the trick if the whole neighbourhood is going down the drain in the end.

[e2] [pro] Pricing pressures are just too high,
[e3] [pro] and his pool of customers is shrinking constantly.
“his”->”Peter’s”
-> and Peter’s pool of customers is shrinking constantly.
[e4] [opp] Of course he could do another big ad campaign,
[e5] [pro] but that won't do the trick if the whole neighbourhood is going down the drain in the end.
[e1] [pro] Peter should close his snack bar as soon as possible.

Comment: usable for survey, somehow could give the impression that it’s intentional to use the main claim as an emphasis  at the end.
