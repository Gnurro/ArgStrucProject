Central claim unit: a1

Original order:
[e1] [pro] Considering what's on television these days, it would be appropriate to only have those people pay who actually (want to) follow the programming.
[e2] [pro] In some cases there are only shows for older generations on at prime times, so why then should everyone pay for this?
[e3] [pro] By now you have advertising on all channels,
[e4] [pro] so there's no advantage for the current paying viewers of the public broadcasters.
[e5] [opp] Nevertheless one has to point out that there'd probably be way fewer stations if it weren’t the whole of Germany that’s obliged to pay.
[e6] [pro] That shouldn't be an issue though, given the sheer number of programmes and stations that essentially show the same things anyway.

Comment:Resolving the pronoun at [e2] requires less further editing. 
The potential confusion arises from the fact that [e2] alludes to [e1].
Additionally, [e2] appears as an emphatic rhetorical main claim, 
potentially leading to a perceived repetition of ideas in [e1]. 
Adding a conclusive connection between [e1] and [e2] could enhance the overall coherence of the text without compromising its usability.
