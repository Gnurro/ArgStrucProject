Central claim unit: a1

Original order:

[e1] [pro] If there were higher fines for leaving dog dirt on pavements, there would presumably be less dog dirt,
[e2] [pro] which in turn would result in generally clean pavements.
[e3] [opp] Higher fines may not be ideal, particularly for financially weaker individuals,
[e4] [pro] but cleaning up after their dogs does happen to be the obligation of the owners.

Inseparable bigrams: [e1, e2] would break sentence and reference
No unit/bigram move no-go
No unit/bigram position no-go

1.2

[e4]: "their"->[e4]"owners" complex enough to contruct a simple NP
