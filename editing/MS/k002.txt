Central claim unit: a1

Original order:
[e1] [pro] Actually it would be justified if all German universities charged tuition fees.
[e2] [pro] As long as it is ensured that the funds really benefit the universities directly, one can continue to regard this as social justice.
[e3] [pro] Those who study later decide this early on, anyway.
[e4] [pro] It's always possible to take out a student loan or to earn a scholarship.
[e5] [pro] To oblige non-academics to finance others' degrees through taxes, however, is not just.
