Central claim unit: a1
Original order:
e1 pro Actually it would be justified if all German universities charged tuition fees.
e2 pro As long as it is ensured that the funds really benefit the universities directly, one can continue to regard this as social justice.
e3 pro Those who study later decide this early on, anyway.
e4 pro It's always possible to take out a student loan or to earn a scholarship.
e5 pro To oblige non-academics to finance others' degrees through taxes, however, is not just.
