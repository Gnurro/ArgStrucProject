Central claim unit: a1

Original order:
[e1] [pro] German universities should on no account charge tuition fees.
[e2] [pro] This would simply mean that only those people with wealthy parents or a previous education and a part-time job while studying would be able to apply for a degree programme in the first place.
[e3] [pro] Even without tuition fees half of the student population has to work while studying and hence has less time for studying or recreation.
[e4] [opp] One could argue that an increase in tuition fees would allow institutions to be better equipped.
[e5] [pro] But what is the good of a wonderfully outfitted university if it doesn't actually allow the majority of clever people to broaden their horizons with all that great equipment?
