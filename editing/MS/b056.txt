Central claim unit: a6

Original order:
[e1] [pro] A violation of international law should be more than enough to consider a reaction!
[e2] [pro] Humanity has made enough mistakes throughout history by waiting too long, and when it has finally reacted, the only remaining option has usually been war.
[e3] [opp] It's to be noted that in our civilized world, in a democratic country, the people can determine their own fate,
[e4] [pro] as long as the motivation of those people isn't triggered by propaganda, corruption and military pressure.
[e5] [pro] Since, however, in Russia besides gas and oil only propaganda and corruption rule,
[e6] [pro] the EU should intervene right away.

1.Inspection

1.1
Inseparable bigrams: [e3],[e4] and [e4], [e5] ; semantically strongly connected ;[e5] supports [e4] which undercuts the rebuttal of [e3]
No bigram/unit move no-gos
Bigram/unit position no-gos: because of the strong semantic relation the inseparable bigrams need to ascent one another

1.2
[e4]: "those"-> [e3] "the people can determine their own fate"; no simple NP is possible

2.Central claim [a6]: Last->first

Move: [1,2,3,4,5,6]->[6,1,2,3,4,5]

[e2] [pro] Humanity has made enough mistakes throughout history by waiting too long, and when it has finally reacted, the only remaining option has usually been war.
[e3] [opp] It's to be noted that in our civilized world, in a democratic country, the people can determine their own fate,
[e4] [pro] as long as the motivation of those people isn't triggered by propaganda, corruption and military pressure.

 “,”->”.”
- “since”
 “however”->” However”

-> However, in Russia besides gas and oil only propaganda and corruption rule.

Comment: Moving central claim from the last to the first position, makes “since” redundant;
Usable for survay
