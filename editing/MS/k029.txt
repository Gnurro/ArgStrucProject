Central claim unit: a1
Original order:
e1 pro No one should have the possibility to pick up the morning-after pill over the counter at the pharmacy.
e2 opp Though there'd be the advantage of forgoing the embarrassment of a visit to the doctor or a nighttime trip to the walk-in clinic,
e3 pro women should still be informed about the risks and have a gynaecological examination before taking it.
e4 pro Furthermore there's the risk that women could use the over-the-counter morning-after pill as a substitute for contraception.
