Central claim unit: a1

Original order:
[e1] [pro] Dog owners should pay higher fines for dog dirt left on pavements,
[e2] [opp] although there aren't enough bins and bag-dispensers for dog dirt.
[e3] [pro] One reason for this is that they have thus far hardly had to fear the consequences despite the obligation to clean up.
[e4] [pro] A higher fine, so dog owners would have to dig deeper into their pockets, is supposed to be a deterrent after all.
[e5] [pro] The city, especially the green spaces, should be kept tidy after all,
[e6] [pro] for they are there for our recreation.
[e7] [pro] Besides you're not allowed to leave other rubbish without punishment.
