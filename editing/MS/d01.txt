Central claim unit: a1

Original order:
[e1] [pro] Freddy and I must be siblings.
[e2] [pro] We both have the exact same two moles on our left arm
[e3] [pro] and you only get that with siblings.
[e4] [opp] My parents say this could also be pure coincidence.
[e5] [pro] But that much of a coincidence is simply impossible.

1.Inspection
1.1
Inseparable bigrams: [e4,e5] breaks refernce
No unit/bigram move no-go
Unit/bigram position no-go : it seems one move is possible;moving [e1], every unit of the text is strongly connected to each other, therefore changing or flipping the units/bigrams make the text incohesive

1.2

[e3]: "that"-> [e2]: "have the exact same two moles on our left arm", whole entity; simple NP not possible
[e4]: "this"->[e2],[e3]: whole entities; simple NP not possible

2.Main claim[a1]:First->last

Move: [1,2,3,4,5]->[2,3,4,5,1]

[e2] [pro] We both have the exact same two moles on our left arm
[e3] [pro] and you only get that with siblings.
[e4] [opp] My parents say this could also be pure coincidence.
[e5] [pro] But that much of a coincidence is simply impossible.
[e1] [pro] Freddy and I must be siblings.

Comment:  This "funny structure" is almost working, only due to the short length of the text, otherwise it wouldn't be possible. 
usable for survey
