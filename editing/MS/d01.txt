d01
Central claim unit: a1
Original order:
[e1] [pro] Freddy and I must be siblings.
[e2] [pro] We both have the exact same two moles on our left arm
[e3] [pro] and you only get that with siblings.
[e4] [opp] My parents say this could also be pure coincidence.
[e5] [pro] But that much of a coincidence is simply impossible.

1.Inspection
1.1
Inseparable bigrams: [e1],[e2],[e3] and [e4],[e5]
unit/bigram move no-go : simple moves seem to be not working,the conditions cannot apply backwards 
Unit/bigram position no-go : every unit of the text is strongly connected to each other, therefore changing or flipping the units/bigrams make the whole text collapse
1.2
No referentials

2.Main claim[a1], [first->last]
Move: [1,2,3,4,5]->[2,3,4,5,1]

[e2] [pro] We both have the exact same two moles on our left arm
[e3] [pro] and you only get that with siblings.
[e4] [opp] My parents say this could also be pure coincidence.
[e5] [pro] But that much of a coincidence is simply impossible.
[e1] [pro] Freddy and I must be siblings.

Comment: the main claim introduces a conditional situation, which in order to be fulfilled without major changes to the original text,
simple unit moves are not possible.
