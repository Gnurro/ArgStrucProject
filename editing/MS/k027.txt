Central claim unit: a1
Original order:
e1 pro The TV license fee should only be collected from those who actually make use of the programming of the public broadcasters.
e2 pro After all there are many people in Germany who pay the fee although they merely use a computer to work.
e3 pro Yet the fees are demanded from everybody who does not apply for a waiver, no matter how many receiver devices actually exist in the household and how they are being used.
e4 opp However it is obvious that the license fee officers are not in a position to check the usage of every single device.
