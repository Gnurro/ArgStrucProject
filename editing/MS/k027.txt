Central claim unit: a1

Original order:
[e1] [pro] The TV license fee should only be collected from those who actually make use of the programming of the public broadcasters.
[e2] [pro] After all there are many people in Germany who pay the fee although they merely use a computer to work.
[e3] [pro] Yet the fees are demanded from everybody who does not apply for a waiver, no matter how many receiver devices actually exist in the household and how they are being used.
[e4] [opp] However it is obvious that the license fee officers are not in a position to check the usage of every single device.
