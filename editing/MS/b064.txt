Central claim unit: a6

Original order:
[e1] [pro] I think Berlin with its two inner-city airports was lucky not having to experience an airplane catastrophe for decades.
[e2] [pro] For safety reasons alone I find continued operation wrong.
[e3] [pro] Also, Berlin urgently needs inner-city areas for business and industry, and for housing.
[e4] [pro] Closing down Tegel will have health benefits for hundreds of thousands in the approach path.
[e5] [pro] These areas will be upgraded economically due to these factors (housing health and employment).
[e6] [pro] After the new BER Airport has been commissioned, Tegel should definitely be closed.
