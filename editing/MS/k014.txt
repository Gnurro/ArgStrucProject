Central claim unit: a1

Original order:
[e1] [pro] Intelligence services should be more closely regulated by parliament,
[e2] [pro] for, as the most recent NSA wiretapping scandal has shown, the federal state government is allegedly not always familiar with the scope of operations of its intelligence services.
[e3] [pro] Checks could contribute to restricting the so far rather opaque scope of action of individual services.
[e4] [opp] Yet it remains questionable whether the actual implementation of such supervision would at the same time lead to a stronger observance of laws,
[e5] [opp] as ultimately this decision is in the hands of the respective government leaders.
