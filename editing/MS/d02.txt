Central claim unit: a1

Original order:
[e1] [pro] Berlin's basketball team has just come out of a sobering season.
[e2] [pro] Especially the home games have seen the team stay behind expectations.
[e3] [pro] A sad highlight: Losing 60:87 to the weakish Mannheimers in a sold-out stadium.
[e4] [opp] Indeed the team ended up third in the league,
[e5] [pro] but given the cost of the star-players one could've expected more.

1.Inspection

Inseparable bigrams: [e1], [e2],[e3] and [e4],[e5]
Unit/bigram move no-go: again simple moves are not possible here, all units are building up on each other
Unit/bigram position no-go: the text is tightly structured and cohesive, for this reason every pre-existing condition should not be disrupted

Comment: Shuffling not possible;the text is becoming unbiguous, without major changes and moving far from the original text.
