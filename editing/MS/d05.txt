Original order:
[e1] [pro] Today I will delete my Facebook account.
[e2] [pro] Not only because I'm constantly astonished about who wants to be my friend.
[e3] [pro] I'm also tired of my data boosting the market value of that corporation.
[e4] [opp] Facebook warns me emphatically that I may lose contact with my friends.
[e5] [pro] And yet now I'll actually have all the more time for them.
