Central claim unit: a1

Original order:
[e1] [pro] Supermarkets and shopping centres should be allowed to open any Sundays and holidays at their discretion.
[e2] [pro] For in this way, Sunday shopping days would be better spread out through the year.
[e3] [pro] Also streets and shops would presumably be emptier
[e4] [pro] as not everyone would be open on the same day.
[e5] [opp] However then you'd have a worse overview of which shop is open on a given day.
