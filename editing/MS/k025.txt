Central claim unit: a5
Original order:
e1 opp Capital punishment is not a solution,
e2 opp as it cannot be ruled out that the judicial process may make mistakes.
e3 pro Criminals should not be put in luxury prisons, though.
e4 pro After all there are criminals who enjoy 'living' in prison for its decent board, no taxes to be paid, no stress with work.
e5 pro Still, the state needs the death penalty as a deterrent to horrific crimes.
