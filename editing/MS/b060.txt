Central claim unit: a5

Original order:
[e1] [opp] Owner-run shops may potentially be overwhelmed by additional work times on Sundays and holidays,
[e2] [pro] then again supermarkets and large shopping centres dominate the market today already.
[e3] [pro] Thus smaller shops could benefit from the additional freedom,
[e4] [pro] as customers are on average more laid-back on Sunday.
[e5] [pro] Opening on Sundays and holidays would therefore help both customers and shops.

Comment: It seems until now that, the move of the central claim from the last to the first position, as in this case, introduces clearer and more structured the main topic.
