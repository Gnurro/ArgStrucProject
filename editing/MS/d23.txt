Comment:In the case of this text, shuffling the sentences disrupts the natural flow of the narrative and diminish the clarity of the intended message.
The original order of the sentences follows a logical sequence: introducing the upcoming skydiving experience, acknowledging the risks, expressing the desire for freedom,
mentioning a side note about Jochen, and concluding with a competitive motivation.
Shuffling the sentences may results in a less coherent and engaging narrative.
In this case, the original order is more effective in conveying the intended progression of ideas.
