Central claim unit: a1
Original order:
e1 pro Germany should by no means introduce capital punishment.
e2 pro If there were capital punishment, this would mean people are allowed to put themselves above others and rule over their lives.
e3 pro Capital punishment would be murder and would have to be punished with the death penalty itself.
e4 pro What, then, ought to be done with criminals who have committed truly awful crimes such as murder or rape - should they simply be allowed to live on
e5 opp although they have taken or destroyed another life?
e6 pro Yes, for it is a much graver punishment to be imprisoned forever and be tortured by one's own thoughts than to be killed quickly and easily by an injection.
