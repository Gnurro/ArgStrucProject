Central claim unit: a1
Original order:
[e1] [pro] I am not of the opinion that the retirement age should be set at 63 years.
[e2] [pro] This would mean that organizations would be lacking a great deal of manpower in the future.
[e3] [pro] The introductory phase of retirement at 63 would also be a particular challenge
[e4] [pro] as upon introduction many current employees of advanced age would immediately be eligible to retire.
[e5] [pro] This is detrimental for Germany as a business location and leaves employers without a transition period.
[e6] [pro] The danger here is that experienced junior staff is not available in sufficient numbers.
