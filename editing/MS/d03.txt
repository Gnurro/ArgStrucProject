Central claim unit: a1
Original order:
[e1] [pro] It was clearly a mistake to include Tom in our football team.
[e2] [pro] He's just not a team player, and often goes it alone.
[e3] [pro] Plus he comes to training way too rarely,
[e4] [opp] although he plays very well without training.
[e5] [pro] But the worst thing is his habit of always complaining to the referee.

1.Inspection
1.1
Inseparable bigrams: [e1],[e2],[e3],[e4] and [e5]
Unit/bigram move no-go: simple moves are not possible here.
Unit/bigram position no-go: the text is tightly structured and cohesive, for this reason every pre-existing condition should not be disrupted.

1.2
[e2],[e3],[e4] : “he” ->[e1] “Tom”; NP: Tom

Comment: No shuffling is possible
