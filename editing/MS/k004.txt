Comment: not usable for survey; In the variant, the coherence of the narrative is affected.
The original order allows for a logical progression of ideas, starting with a potential challenge, providing positive counterpoints, introducing a broader perspective,
offering examples, and concluding with the main proposition. 
Shuffling the sentences disrupts this flow, making the text less effective in conveying its intended message.
