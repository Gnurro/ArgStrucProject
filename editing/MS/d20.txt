Central claim unit: a1

Original order:

[e1] [pro] The prototype of Audi's new sports car has car lovers raving.
[e2] [opp] The steering system may still need a bit of tweaking,
[e3] [opp] as the car jack-knifes at higher speeds,
[e4] [opp] and surely you'll want to be speeding a lot with that beauty.
[e5] [pro] But aside from that the car caters to pretty much every wish.

1.Inspection

1.1

Inseparable bigrams: [e2,e3,e4] strong contextual cohesion, seperating would break sentence and reference
No unit/bigram move no-go
No unit/bigram position no-go

1.2

[e5]: "that"-> [e2],[e3] whole entity; not possible for a simple NP

2.Main claim[a1]: First->last

Move:[1,2,3,4,5]->[2,3,4,5,1]


[e2] [opp] The steering system may still need a bit of tweaking,
[e3] [opp] as the car jack-knifes at higher speeds,
[e4] [opp] and surely you'll want to be speeding a lot with that beauty.
[e5] [pro] But aside from that the car caters to pretty much every wish.
[e1] [pro] The prototype of Audi's new sports car has car lovers raving.

Comment: Even though [e2] directly opposes the main claim this simple move doesn't collapse the argument relation; 
the use of a concluding remark as "thus" or "therefore" would make the text more elloquent.
