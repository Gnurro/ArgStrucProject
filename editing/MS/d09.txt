Central claim unit: a1

Original order:
[e1] [pro] You should watch less television,
[e2] [pro] as too much TV makes you stupid in the long run,
[e3] [pro] like your brother.
[e4] [opp] It would be an exception if you only watched quiz shows,
[e5] [pro] but you tend to watch Big Brother and X-Diaries.

1.Inspection

1.1
Inseparable bigrams: [e1],[e2],[e3] mostly because of strong [e3]->[e2] and [e4],[e5]
Unit/bigram move no-go: simple moves with minimum editing are not possible in this example. 
Unit/bigram position no-go: it is important, that all units/bigram position does not change because of the strong topical cohesion of the text

1.2
No referentials

Comment: No shuffling is possible,also this is a text of a personal argument in comparison with the majority of the others. The main claim serves 
as a suggestion as well directly to a person with implications.
