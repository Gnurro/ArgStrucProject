Central claim unit: a1
Original order:
[e1] [pro] You should watch less television,
[e2] [pro] as too much TV makes you stupid in the long run,
[e3] [pro] like your brother.
[e4] [opp] It would be an exception if you only watched quiz shows,
[e5] [pro] but you tend to watch Big Brother and X-Diaries.

1.Inspection
1.1
Inseparable bigrams: [e1],[e2],[e3] and [e4],[e5]
Unit/bigram move no-go: simple moves with minimum editing are not possible in this example. Every argument leads to the next one, thus is strongly cohesive and not breakable.
Unit/bigram position no-go: it is important, that all units/bigram position does not change because of the strong cohesion of the text
1.2
No referentials

Comment: No shuffling is possible
