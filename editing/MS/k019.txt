Central claim unit: a6
Original order:
e1 pro The thought of television exclusively made up of private channels scares me.
e2 opp Admittedly trash and turmoil are exactly what the majority of people want to see.
e3 pro But to therefore offer TV according to audience rates only would be dangerous.
e4 pro Only in public TV programmes can viewers get information that is not profit-oriented.
e5 pro And since it is the duty of society to collectively finance certain areas that cannot hold their own in a market economy,
e6 pro everyone should chip in.
