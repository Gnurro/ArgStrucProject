Central claim unit: a1

Original order:
[e1] [pro] BER should be re-conceptualized from scratch,
[e2] [opp] even if billions of Euros have already been invested in the existing airport project
[e3] [opp] and this would delay the date of completion indefinitely.
[e4] [pro] Both the drawn-out building operations and the mounting safety issues show clear shortcomings in the entire planning.

Comment: Shuffling these sentences might disrupt the logical progression of the argument. 
If,for example, [e1] is placed before [e4], it could create confusion, as [e1] appears to be the main claim without the context of the shortcomings presented in [e4]. 
Placing [e2] before [e4] also disrupt the flow because the acknowledgment of financial investment in [e2] is better understood after the shortcomings are outlined in [e4].
Basically, the original order follows a logical sequence: 
identifying issues, presenting a counterpoint, and proposing a solution. 
Shuffling might hinder the clarity and coherence of this argument.
Not usable for survey.
