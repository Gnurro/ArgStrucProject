# Linear Argument Structure
This is a repository for scripts and extracted data.
## Corpus
The corpus files used are available at https://github.com/peldszus/arg-microtexts .  
Download the `corpus` directory from there and place it in the root directory of this project/repo. 
(A setup script that downloads it can be made later.)  
Current exploration scripts expect it to be accessible using the path `corpus/`.
## Branches
Once we start to work on code together, we should do so on dev branches to not run into conflicts.  
For now just putting things on `main` should be fine.
