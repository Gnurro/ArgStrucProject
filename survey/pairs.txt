Yes, it's annoying and cumbersome to separate your rubbish properly all the time. Three different bin bags stink away in the kitchen and have to be sorted into different wheelie bins. But still Germany produces way too much rubbish and too many resources are lost when what actually should be separated and recycled is burnt. We Berliners should take the chance and become pioneers in waste separation!

For one thing, inviolable human dignity is anchored in our constitution, and furthermore no one may have the right to adjudicate upon the death of another human being. Even if many people think that a murderer has already decided on the life or death of another person, this is precisely the crime that we should not repay with the same. The death penalty is a legal means that as such is not practicable in Germany.

Perhaps a new life was already created that night. I would kill it without further thought. That's why a visit to the doctor and professional advice should remain mandatory.

Clearly a landlord has to pay for some repairs before a new lease. But surely these costs could be covered by a minimal increase in rent over the course of the entire lease. All the more so as for an adequate profit the rental rate as compared to the base rent need not be raised for every new lease. It is unfair and unjustifiable that new tenants have to pay a much higher rent than previous residents.

It should be in the interest of the health insurers to recognize alternative medicine as treatment, since there is a chance of recovery. It doesn't matter after all that those who administer the treatment don't have 'doctor status'. Since both methods can lead to the prevention, mitigation or cure of an illness, alternative treatments should be subsidized in the same way as conventional treatments.

Some may find the idea of a school uniform anachronistic, or regard it as too much of an intervention into the leeway of students and parents to make decisions. Indeed, however, it's already the case today that students of apparently 'uniform-free' schools are essentially wearing a uniform consisting of certain brand-name garments. A simply designed practical outfit would even out the overall visual image of a school, and direct attention towards the character and achievements of the students - and not their buying power.

The idea of the bachelor degree is to put together a cumulative grade from various individual assignments in order to generate a final grade. This is also more akin to the real working world later, where performance isn't singular, but constant and has to be delivered over longer periods. That's why it makes sense that the bachelor thesis only makes up a relatively small portion of the final grade (15 out of 120 credits). However, the effort required for the individual equally weighted modules differs strongly. It would therefore be wise to adjust the required effort for final theses accordingly.

The introductory phase of retirement at 63 would be a particular challenge, as upon introduction many current employees of advanced age would immediately be eligible to retire. This is detrimental for Germany as a business location and leaves employers without a transition period. The danger here is that experienced junior staff is not available in sufficient numbers. This would also mean that organizations would be lacking a great deal of manpower in the future. I am not of the opinion that the retirement age should be set at 63 years.
I am not of the opinion that the retirement age should be set at 63 years. This would mean that organizations would be lacking a great deal of manpower in the future. The introductory phase of retirement at 63 would also be a particular challenge as upon introduction many current employees of advanced age would immediately be eligible to retire.

I think Berlin with its two inner-city airports was lucky not having to experience an airplane catastrophe for decades. For safety reasons alone I find continued operation wrong. Also, Berlin urgently needs inner-city areas for business and industry, and for housing. Closing down Tegel will have health benefits for hundreds of thousands in the approach path. These areas will be upgraded economically due to these factors (housing health and employment). After the new BER Airport has been commissioned, Tegel should definitely be closed.

We both have the exact same two moles on our left arm and you only get that with siblings. My parents say this could also be pure coincidence. But that much of a coincidence is simply impossible. Freddy and I must be siblings.

Tom's just not a team player, and often goes it alone. Plus he comes to training way too rarely, although he plays very well without training. But the worst thing is his habit of always complaining to the referee. It was clearly a mistake to include Tom in our football team.

The life expectancy is constantly rising, and at the same time birth rates are declining. Although having children has become more fashionable again in recent years, these short-term fluctuations in birth rates don't change the general trend at all. In a few decades our society will have a disproportionate number of old people.

The younger generations are no longer dependent on the programming of public broadcasters. US series are preferred over “Tatort”, and online magazines are turned to instead of the “Tagesthemen”. The TV & radio licence enables economically independent journalism. But as long as the licence payers have no say in the distribution of the funds, the fee quite rightly annoys them. Not everyone should be obliged to pay the TV & radio licence.

As long as it is ensured that the funds really benefit the universities directly, one can continue to regard this as social justice. Those who study later decide this early on, anyway. It's always possible to take out a student loan or to earn a scholarship. To oblige non-academics to finance others' degrees through taxes, however, is not just. Actually it would be justified if all German universities charged tuition fees.

If Germany were to introduce the death penalty, convicted felons could not be paroled or break out of prison and commit new felonies. However, a death would not be of any more use to those affected and their relatives than if the felon receives a long sentence. Plus we don't live in medieval times anymore. Handing out capital punishment is unethical. We don't need it.

If there were capital punishment, this would mean people are allowed to put themselves above others and rule over other people's lives. Capital punishment would be murder and would have to be punished with the death penalty itself. What, then, ought to be done with criminals who have committed truly awful crimes such as murder or rape - should criminals simply be allowed to live on although criminals have taken or destroyed another life? Yes, for it is a much graver punishment to be imprisoned forever and be tortured by one's own thoughts than to be killed quickly and easily by an injection. Germany should by no means introduce capital punishment.

In some cases there are only shows for older generations on at prime times, so why then should everyone pay for television? By now you have advertising on all channels, so there's no advantage for the current paying viewers of the public broadcasters. Nevertheless one has to point out that there'd probably be way fewer stations if it weren’t the whole of Germany that’s obliged to pay. That shouldn't be an issue though, given the sheer number of programmes and stations that essentially show the same things anyway. Considering what's on television these days, it would be appropriate to only have those people pay who actually (want to) follow the programming.

Tuition fees would simply mean that only those people with wealthy parents or a previous education and a part-time job while studying would be able to apply for a degree programme in the first place. Even without tuition fees half of the student population has to work while studying and hence has less time for studying or recreation. One could argue that an increase in tuition fees would allow institutions to be better equipped. But what is the good of a wonderfully outfitted university if it doesn't actually allow the majority of clever people to broaden their horizons with all that great equipment? German universities should on no account charge tuition fees.

The most recent NSA wiretapping scandal has shown, the federal state government is allegedly not always familiar with the scope of operations of its intelligence services. Checks could contribute to restricting the so far rather opaque scope of action of individual services. Yet it remains questionable whether the actual implementation of such supervision would at the same time lead to a stronger observance of laws, as ultimately this decision is in the hands of the respective government leaders. Intelligence services should be more closely regulated by parliament.

As the population in Germany has, viewed demographically, a disproportionate number of old people, and constantly declining birth rates are being recorded. Admittedly the number of immigrants is constantly rising in Germany, but without sufficient, well-qualified junior employees there is hardly a possibility for adequate pension financing. The implementation of retirement at 63 is no longer socially sustainable.

Our society is in danger of overheating due to 'never clocking off'. Even though politicians stress the Christian character of our country, the last 20 years have seen the Sunday off work increasingly sacrificed to commerce. But after all, the purpose of having a day off is not just to make time to go to church. Rather it should give people the chance to have a mental break. That's why there ought to be one day a week when supermarkets and shopping centres stay closed.

The thought of television exclusively made up of private channels scares me. Admittedly trash and turmoil are exactly what the majority of people want to see. But to therefore offer TV according to audience rates only would be dangerous. Only in public TV programmes can viewers get information that is not profit-oriented. And since it is the duty of society to collectively finance certain areas that cannot hold their own in a market economy, everyone should chip in.

'Property entails commitment' is one of the tenets of our social order. Everyone should be able to get the utmost profit from his or her property. A fixing of rent prices according to the market alone, however, will lead to a further division of society. The rich and poor live in different neighbourhoods. A constant increase in rent upon a change of tenants hence cannot be desired by society.

Thus Sundays should remain a day for getting together with family, otherwise there will be a new kind of leisure activity where people spend their time in supermarkets instead of outside or in conversation etc. Furthermore, there's no need to keep shops open on Sundays.

A higher fine, so dog owners would have to dig deeper into their pockets, is supposed to be a deterrent after all.
