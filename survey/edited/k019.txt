Central claim unit: a6

Original order:
[e1] [pro] The thought of television exclusively made up of private channels scares me.
[e2] [opp] Admittedly trash and turmoil are exactly what the majority of people want to see.
[e3] [pro] But to therefore offer TV according to audience rates only would be dangerous.
[e4] [pro] Only in public TV programmes can viewers get information that is not profit-oriented.
[e5] [pro] And since it is the duty of society to collectively finance certain areas that cannot hold their own in a market economy,
[e6] [pro] everyone should chip in.

Comment:usable for survey; [e6] at the begging seems like a prompt
