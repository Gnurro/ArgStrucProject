Central claim unit: a5

Original order:
[e1] [pro] Rent prices are already regulated in favour of tenants due to existing laws and the rent index.
[e2] [pro] In view of the high prices for buying flats with existing rent contracts, these are an unattractive investment.
[e3] [opp] Even if one might think that additional rent control is needed besides the current tenant protection,
[e4] [pro] one should not deny longstanding owners the opportunity to adjust their returns to market level.
[e5] [pro] A cap on rent increases upon tenant change is therefore not to be supported.
