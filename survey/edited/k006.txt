Central claim unit: a5

Original order:
[e1] [opp] If Germany were to introduce the death penalty, convicted felons could not be paroled or break out of prison and commit new felonies.
[e2] [pro] However, a death would not be of any more use to those affected and their relatives than if the felon receives a long sentence.
[e3] [pro] Plus we don't live in medieval times anymore.
[e4] [pro] Handing out capital punishment is unethical.
[e5] [pro] We don't need it.
