Opening on Sundays and holidays would help both customers and shops.
Owner-run shops may potentially be overwhelmed by additional work times on Sundays and holidays,
then again supermarkets and large shopping centres dominate the market today already.
Thus smaller shops could benefit from the additional freedom,
as customers are on average more laid-back on Sunday.
