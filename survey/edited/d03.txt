Central claim unit: a1

Original order:
[e1] [pro] It was clearly a mistake to include Tom in our football team.
[e2] [pro] He's just not a team player, and often goes it alone.
[e3] [pro] Plus he comes to training way too rarely,
[e4] [opp] although he plays very well without training.
[e5] [pro] But the worst thing is his habit of always complaining to the referee.
