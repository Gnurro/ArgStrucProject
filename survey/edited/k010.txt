Central claim unit: a1

Original order:
[e1] [pro] Considering what's on television these days, it would be appropriate to only have those people pay who actually (want to) follow the programming.
[e2] [pro] In some cases there are only shows for older generations on at prime times, so why then should everyone pay for this?
[e3] [pro] By now you have advertising on all channels,
[e4] [pro] so there's no advantage for the current paying viewers of the public broadcasters.
[e5] [opp] Nevertheless one has to point out that there'd probably be way fewer stations if it weren’t the whole of Germany that’s obliged to pay.
[e6] [pro] That shouldn't be an issue though, given the sheer number of programmes and stations that essentially show the same things anyway.

1.Inspection

1.1
No inseparable bigrams
No unit/bigram move no-go
No unit/bigram position no-go

1.2
[e2]:"this"->[e1]:"television"->television
[e6]:"That"->[e5]:"there'd probably be way fewer stations";too complex to construct a simple NP

Comment:Resolving the pronoun at [e2] requires less further editing (deleting "in some cases", for example, as it refers to [e1] and the fact that people have to pay for television even if they dont use it) and it could be also confused 
as the emphatic rhetorical main claim. It seems now that [e1] is repeating somehow [e2] as a conclusion. Again a conclusive connecting could smoothen the text;but it is usable
