Central claim unit: a1

Original order:
[e1] [pro] No one should have the possibility to pick up the morning-after pill over the counter at the pharmacy.
[e2] [opp] Though there'd be the advantage of forgoing the embarrassment of a visit to the doctor or a nighttime trip to the walk-in clinic,
[e3] [pro] women should still be informed about the risks and have a gynaecological examination before taking it.
[e4] [pro] Furthermore there's the risk that women could use the over-the-counter morning-after pill as a substitute for contraception.

Comment:can be used for the survey; if the text was longer moving the main claim to the end would not be possible due to the distance and the fact that at the beggining the context is ambiguous
