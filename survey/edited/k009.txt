Central claim unit: a1

Original order:
[e1] [pro] Germany should by no means introduce capital punishment.
[e2] [pro] If there were capital punishment, this would mean people are allowed to put themselves above others and rule over their lives.
[e3] [pro] Capital punishment would be murder and would have to be punished with the death penalty itself.
[e4] [pro] What, then, ought to be done with criminals who have committed truly awful crimes such as murder or rape - should they simply be allowed to live on
[e5] [opp] although they have taken or destroyed another life?
[e6] [pro] Yes, for it is a much graver punishment to be imprisoned forever and be tortured by one's own thoughts than to be killed quickly and easily by an injection.
