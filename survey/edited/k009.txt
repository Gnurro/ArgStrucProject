If there were capital punishment, this would mean people are allowed to put themselves above others and rule over other people's lives.
Capital punishment would be murder and would have to be punished with the death penalty itself.
What, then, ought to be done with criminals who have committed truly awful crimes such as murder or rape - should criminals simply be allowed to live on
although criminals have taken or destroyed another life?
Yes, for it is a much graver punishment to be imprisoned forever and be tortured by one's own thoughts than to be killed quickly and easily by an injection.
Germany should by no means introduce capital punishment.
