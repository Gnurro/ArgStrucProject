Yes, it's annoying and cumbersome to separate your rubbish properly all the time. Three different bin bags stink away in the kitchen and have to be sorted into different wheelie bins. But still Germany produces way too much rubbish and too many resources are lost when what actually should be separated and recycled is burnt. We Berliners should take the chance and become pioneers in waste separation!

Clearly a landlord has to pay for some repairs before a new lease. But surely these costs could be covered by a minimal increase in rent over the course of the entire lease. All the more so as for an adequate profit the rental rate as compared to the base rent need not be raised for every new lease. It is unfair and unjustifiable that new tenants have to pay a much higher rent than previous residents.

Olympic events are rooted in old traditions. On the other hand, the events have a culturally determined character. Our society is strongly digitized and influenced by computers. Yet sports are usually associated with physical training. Since however skat, chess etc. are not accepted as Olympic events, computer games should also not be recognized as Olympic events.

People are getting older on average, but they are not sicker and not duller because of it. Without them we'd forgo a great deal of collected experience. And we'd have to offer more leisure activities for seniors. No, the retirement age should be raised to 65 again.

University tuition fees in Germany would impede or prevent access to those who are financially weaker. The anticipated objectives of tuition fees can be achieved by other means. There are other instruments to motivate tighter discipline while studying. And funding-wise it ought to be considered how costs incurred by students from other (federal) states can be reimbursed. The universities in Germany should not under any circumstances charge tuition fees.

Dog dirt is disgusting and a hygiene problem. Also children, adults and other animals aren't allowed to leave droppings on the pavement. If you dispose of the waste then and there yourself, no fine is necessary. There should be a higher fine for dog dirt on the pavement.

The Tempelhofer Feld is right in the middle of the city (capital). The size of the field allows for both housing and generous open space. I find the peripheral housing development at Tempelhofer Feld right for urban planning reasons.

Universities are for all citizens, independent of their finances. Education and training are fundamental rights which the state, the society must provide. If a university lacks the funds, sponsors must be found. Unfortunately this can lead to disagreeable dependencies in some cases. Tuition fees should not generally be charged by universities.

Even with state-of-the-art contraceptives there can be mistakes and problems and an unwanted pregnancy can place a significant strain on both the parents and the child for the rest of their lives. Some worry about careless use of such measures, but this problem should rather be addressed with comprehensive prior education. The morning-after pill ought to be available over-the-counter in pharmacies.

Stepping in dog dirt is gross and absolutely ruins your day due to the dirt, the stench and the often considerable effort to get rid of it. Besides, the fines for public urination by a human are higher than for leaving behind dog dirt on the pavement, which is disproportionate. Some dog owners assume that paying a dog licence fee covers the removal of such waste, but according to this logic one could hardly make the taxpayer accountable for almost any offense. There should be much higher fines for dog dirt left on pavements.

Intelligence services apparently enjoy indiscriminate liberties. No one can follow their activities in detail. Of course a certain level of secrecy is the basis for the work of intelligence services. The unregulated work of the secret services, however, carries the danger of misuse of their authority. That's why intelligence services must be regulated in the framework of parliamentary oversight committees.

The morning-after pill has a number of side effects. A differentiated analysis of its side effects is not achievable for a layperson without medical advice. However these are clearly stated on the package insert, and a request for an early termination of a pregnancy is the right of every woman. The morning-after pill should only be prescribed after counselling by a physician or pharmacist.

But education must not be a question of money in a wealthy society such as Germany. Therefore universities should not charge tuition fees in Germany.

Germany's aging society is undergoing demographic change, and the age of those who are physically and mentally fit is increasing steadily. Thus social security and pension costs are increasing. Yet no one should be required to work for more than 40 years. Raising the relative retirement age on the basis of the physical fitness of the average citizen is fair.

Due to the increase in opening hours on Sundays and holidays there is a rise in employment. However it's mainly temps (that is, students, pupils etc.) who are employed, so this has hardly any effect on the level of full-time employment and the number of unemployed. On top of that, private and family life suffers massively because of this reduction and shifting in designated off-times. And it’s only the large companies that can afford the additional personnel expenditure. For these reasons supermarkets and shopping centres should not be allowed to be open for business on arbitrary Sundays and holidays.

For years there has been a housing shortage in Berlin, so that using Tempelhofer Feld, which offers a lot of open space and is currently hardly developed, as living space is a sensible idea. Since the area belongs to the federal state, or the federation, it could even be used for social housing with affordable rents. Admittedly the fields have currently become an attractive leisure park with sporting areas for many visitors and Berliners, especially in spring and summer. If however one could find a compromise between green space and housing, then Tempelhofer Feld should definitely be made available for residential construction.

A violation of international law should be more than enough to consider a reaction! Humanity has made enough mistakes throughout history by waiting too long, and when it has finally reacted, the only remaining option has usually been war. It's to be noted that in our civilized world, in a democratic country, the people can determine their own fate, as long as the motivation of those people isn't triggered by propaganda, corruption and military pressure. Since, however, in Russia besides gas and oil only propaganda and corruption rule, the EU should intervene right away.

Retirement at 63, that's something everyone who has toiled away (nonstop) up to this point surely deserves. Only the question remains whether this early 'leisure' will be nicer if you have no idea what do to all day and you statistically still have almost 20 (!!!) years to go? Also, one isn't taking responsibility for society if one gives up one's experienced, healthy and highly qualified capabilities earlier than necessary for private/personal reasons. Especially now, as there is a lack of skilled labour, it's irresponsible for the economy and prosperity to retire at 63.

Owner-run shops may potentially be overwhelmed by additional work times on Sundays and holidays, then again supermarkets and large shopping centres dominate the market today already. Thus smaller shops could benefit from the additional freedom, as customers are on average more laid-back on Sunday. Opening on Sundays and holidays would therefore help both customers and shops.

I think Berlin with its two inner-city airports was lucky not having to experience an airplane catastrophe for decades. For safety reasons alone I find continued operation wrong. Also, Berlin urgently needs inner-city areas for business and industry, and for housing. Closing down Tegel will have health benefits for hundreds of thousands in the approach path. These areas will be upgraded economically due to these factors (housing health and employment). After the new BER Airport has been commissioned, Tegel should definitely be closed.

If Germany were to introduce the death penalty, convicted felons could not be paroled or break out of prison and commit new felonies. However, a death would not be of any more use to those affected and their relatives than if the felon receives a long sentence. Plus we don't live in medieval times anymore. Handing out capital punishment is unethical. We don't need it.

The thought of television exclusively made up of private channels scares me. Admittedly trash and turmoil are exactly what the majority of people want to see. But to therefore offer TV according to audience rates only would be dangerous. Only in public TV programmes can viewers get information that is not profit-oriented. And since it is the duty of society to collectively finance certain areas that cannot hold their own in a market economy, everyone should chip in.

'Property entails commitment' is one of the tenets of our social order. Everyone should be able to get the utmost profit from his or her property. A fixing of rent prices according to the market alone, however, will lead to a further division of society. The rich and poor live in different neighbourhoods. A constant increase in rent upon a change of tenants hence cannot be desired by society.
